      <h2>TERMS OF USE</h2>
      <p>
        Last Updated: March 3, 2022
      </p>
      <p>Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because
they govern your use of the website located at joystickgames.com and the content and functionalities
accessible via the Site (collectively, the “Site”) offered by the Joystick Games (“Joystick Games”), a
Cayman Islands foundation limited by guarantee and without share capital.
</p>
      <p>The Joystick Games maintains the Site as a portal for information, news and updates about the
decentralized digital ecosystem utilizing units of value denominated as “Joystick Tokens.” For the
avoidance of doubt, the Joystick Games does not control the blockchain on which Joystick Tokens are
tradable or useable (the “Protocol”) and cannot control activity and data on the Protocol, the validation of
transactions on the Protocol, or use of the Protocol. The Protocol is an open-source protocol that is
maintained and processed by validators across the globe.</p>
      <p>Agreement to Terms. By using our Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be
bound by these Terms, do not use the Site.
</p>
      <p>Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Site, for information
on how we collect, use, and share your information.
</p>
      <p>Changes to these Terms or the Site. We may update the Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. If
we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site. It’s important that you review the
Terms whenever we update them or you use the Site. If you continue to use the Site after we have posted
updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the
changes, you may not use the Site anymore. We may change or discontinue all or any part of the Site, at
any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
</p>
      <p>Who May Use the Site? You may use the Site only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a
binding contract with the Joystick Games, and not otherwise barred from using the Site under applicable
law.</p>
      <p>Feedback. We value your feedback on the Site, but please don’t send us suggestions for improvements,
creative ideas, designs, pitch portfolios, or other materials (collectively “Unsolicited Ideas”). This policy is
aimed at avoiding potential disputes or misunderstandings when our Site might seem similar to
Unsolicited Ideas that people submit. We may currently be developing, have developed, or in the future
will develop ideas or materials internally or receive ideas or materials from other parties that may be
similar to Unsolicited Ideas. If you ignore this policy and send us your Unsolicited Ideas anyway, you grant
us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and
transferable license under any and all intellectual property or other rights that you own or control to use,
copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import, and
otherwise exploit in any manner or medium whatsoever known now or in the future your Unsolicited Ideas
for any purpose, without compensation to you.
</p>
